							<p> Our mission is to simplify outstation road travel anywhere in India. 'Gozo' means 'delight and joy'! We started Gozo Cabs because we felt that there was a need to make outstation road travel in India 'delightful'. </p>
							<p class="heading-inner merriw mt30"><b>We know what you want when you book an outstation taxi - </b></p>
<div class="float-right"><img src="/images/img-2022/side-img-1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid ml20 mb10 mt30 side-img"></div>
							<ul>
								<li>You want reliable transportation in an AC cab. You want it everywhere, not just in the major metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai or Kolkata.</li>
								<li>You want to pay a low price and get great service. </li>
								<li>While its common to haggle in India - most of us don't like to bargain. </li>
								<li>You don't want guesswork. You simply want to book with one company and let them find you a taxi that meets your budget and needs.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="font-18 mt30 merriw"><b>At Gozo, we're bringing you just what you need.</b></p>
							<p>Gozo is the easiest way to book and enjoy a chauffer-driven road trip at the right price all over India. At Gozo, we're making it - </p>
							<ul>
								<li>  <b>CONVENIENT</b> - Book one-way outstation trips, round-trip journeys, hourly car rental packages, airport pick and drop service or multi-city packaged itineraries with Gozo. </li>
								<li>  <b>EASY TO RENT</b> - WE're Book on the web, on your mobile phone. </li> 
								<li>  <b>AVAILABLE ALL OVER INDIA </b> - Travel from or to over 1000 towns and cities across India. We aim to provide the best service at a fair price. We may not be the cheapest but we strive to be the best.</li>
								<li>  <b>BARGAIN-FREE PRICING</b> - Since you don't like to bargain and haggle, We don't. Your price and payment terms are clearly listed on your booking confirmation. Extra kms are billed separately. Payment terms for parking, tolls and taxes are also clearly stated.</li>
								<li>  <b>QUALITY SERVICE</b> - We do our part to ensure that the taxi operator will provide good service and honour time commitments.</li>
								<li>  <b>ALWAYS IMPROVING</b> - We ask you to review our driver, car and customer service for every trip. Please tell us and be very frank. We take your input seriously and are working to get better every day. </li>
							</ul>
							<p>We also make to make it clear that we're a technology based marketplace. We're not a taxi service operator. We work with taxi operators who will serve your trip and want your business.<br> 
								Because we work with these operators more regularly than you would, they tend to pay more attention to our requests and comply with the requirements we set forth. 
								Lets just say we have a little more convincing power and negotiation muscle. 
								<br>
								So there is a much lower chance of your car being late or dirty when you book through Gozo. We only work with reliable taxi operators. If a taxi operator doesn't meet our requirements they don't get business on our platform.  
								<b>Our goal is simple.</b> To serve you better than anyone else can in India. And we do that by bringing you the best prices, quality services and great support. 

								<br><br>So Dear friend, if you need to travel outstation just remember our mantra...<br>
								<b>"idhar udhar kyu khojo, just get a Gozo!"</b>
