		<p class="font-16 mb5"><b>Dear Gozo partner</b> </p>
		<p>With Gozo NOW we're putting the power in the hands of our Gozo partners to serve last minute bookings. Any customer who needs a taxi within the next 4-6 hours will automatically be connected with Gozo partners using our Gozo NOW technology.</p>
<p>Any Gozo booking that is created within 3 hours of pick- up time will fall under GozoNow category. To benefit from this feature, please do the following ASAP.</p>
<h4>How this technology works</h4>
<p>Customer makes a request for the taxi and we directly send that requirement to you. You can reply with what amount you require for the trip, which car/driver you will use and how quickly you can reachthe pickup location. We will show all partner offers to the customer. </p>
<p>Customer directly chooses the Gozo partner whose offer (price, timing, rating etc) that they like. As soon as customer chooses your offer and makes the advance payment, we notify you to leave for the customer pickup location. To benefit from Gozo NOW, you must do the following -</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure all your cars and drivers are approved with Gozo.</li>
<li>Ensure you are logged into the Gozo partner app and on all the time.</li>
<li>Ask your drivers to remain logged in on Gozo driver app so the real-time location of the vehicle is known to Gozo.</li>
<li>Maintain 4 star or higher service ratings by serving customers professionally.</li>
<li>Keep cars clean and ensure drivers behave politely.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even new Gozo partners can get the benefit of Gozo NOW. We are soon launching Local point to point within-the-city bookings and are <a href="http://www.aaocab.com/vendor/join">inviting taxi owners to attach your car to Gozo platform today for â‚¹0 </a> in partner security deposit fees.
