				<p>As a best practice, we require that all the cities that you plan to visit should be listed in your written trip itinerary provided to you by Gozo. This way you have complete clarity on the pricing for the trip and the driver and operator have received proper communication regarding your trip plan. This ensures that there is no confusion and the price  quote you receive from Gozo takes your entire trip plan into account. By using this best practice you can avoid any surprises in terms of additional charges for kms driven or changes to itinerary.</p>

			<div class="accordion-content" id="accordion-f13">
				<p>Gozo specializes in intercity / outstation transportation services all over India. Each state has different rules and requirements for use of tourist vehicles. In addition, there are restrictions placed on where tourist vehicles can travel to based on rules set by local unions or city ordinances.</p>
				<p>All vehicles you hire are quoted with a fixed amount of kms associated with the exact itinerary listed in your confirmation. Usage of the vehicle outside of the documented itinerary and/or beyond the listed kms may be subject to additional charges. Your use of the vehicle is limited to the activities that are clearly listed on your booking confirmation (booking contract)</p>
				<p><b>Example 1:</b> If you are traveling from City A to City B and back, then you may use the vehicle to leave from City A, goto City B, travel within City B (as long as its within the quoted kms) and return back to City A. </p>
				<p>If you wish to make short trips outside of City B to points of interest or tourist sites in towns/cities neighboring to City B, this needs to be first clearly listed in your trip plan. If its not listed in your trip plan this activity is not included and will be chargeable as extra. The rate per km that gets billed will be higher for hilly roads vs flat terrain</p>
				<p><b>Example 2:</b> If you are taking a one-way transfer from city A to city B, then you can only take the vehicle from your pickup address to your drop address. 
					Any intermediate pickup points (pick a friend, drop a friend etc) will need to be specified in your booking confirmation (booking contract) and would be separately billable if not listed on the contract.</p>
				<p>We care for our customers and work hard to meet all your requests. We want you to have a special trip or vacation. Simply give us a call and we will work with you provide you the best solution for your needs. <br>
					For all queries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@aaocab.com" class="color-highlight">info@aaocab.com</a> or simply call our help line
				</p>
				<p><b>Example 3:</b> If you are hiring a vehicle for a round trip from City A to to City B and back to City A, you must let us know if you desire to use the vehicle for local sight-seeing in City A (city of departure).  We need a clear itinerary of your plan so it can be documented 
					& communicated to the driver</p>
				<p><b>Any use of the vehicle outside of what is documented in your trip itinerary is considered unauthorized and may be subject to additional charges. </b></p>

			<div class="accordion-content" id="accordion-f17">
				<p>Price is what you pay and value is what you get.</p>
				<p>At Gozo, we focus on delivering the highest value for a fair price. In addition, our quotes are transparent with no pricing surprises later. Our philosophy is to not just get your business today but to get it forever after.</p>
				<p>Sure it is possible that you may get a quote lower than ours, and thats where its important that you compare apples to apples.</p>
				<p>When looking at a lower quote, here are some pricing traps to watch for....</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Is the vehicle commercially licensed (YELLOW NUMBER PLATE) and driver commercially licensed? You do not want to travel in a private vehicle. Its not only illegal but also unsafe to use a private vehicle instead of one with a commercial permit
					</li>
					<li>Private vehicles are either uninsured or inadequately insured, lack commercial permits, evade paying tourist taxes and fees and may be using drivers with questionable driving experience or records.</li>
					<li>Most companies will low ball you with quotes that only include base fare and may quote too few included kms for your trip. (Its a classis bait and switch scam)</li>
					<li>Those providers would add on daily driver allowances, state taxes, toll taxes, excess km charges to your final bill and extort you for far more money than you had expected. This will lead to a unpleasant experience. Gozo always provides you a written quote (our confirmation email has all the details...read it carefully) and its best that you compare our written quote with theirs. </li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Transparent apples-apples comparison is best when you are comparing Gozo's pricing with others.
						You will find that in 99% of the situations, you not only save more but also have a great experience with Gozo. With Gozo you get a good price and great value.</b></p>
