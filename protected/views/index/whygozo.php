            <p> Our mission is to simplify outstation road travel anywhere in India. 'Gozo' means 'delight and joy'! We started Gozo Cabs because we felt that there was a need to make outstation road travel in India 'delightful'. </p>
            
            <h4 class="m0 mb20 weight400">We know what you want when you book an outstation taxi - </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>  You want reliable transportation in an AC cab. You want it everywhere, not just in the major metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai or Kolkata.</li>

                    <li>  While its common to haggle in India - most of us don't like to bargain. </li>
                    <li>  You don't want guesswork. You simply want to book with one company and let them find you a taxi that meets your budget and needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br> 
            <h4 class="m0 mb20 weight400">At Gozo, we're bringing you just what you need. </h4>

                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We also make to make it clear that we're a technology based marketplace. We're not a taxi service operator. We work with taxi operators who will serve your trip and want your business.<br> 
                   Because we work with these operators more regularly than you would, they tend to pay more attention to our requests and comply with the requirements we set forth. 
                   Lets just say we have a little more convincing power and negotiation muscle. 
                   <br>
                   So there is a much lower chance of your car being late or dirty when you book through Gozo. We only work with reliable taxi operators. If a taxi operator doesn't meet our requirements they don't get business on our platform.  
                   <b>Our goal is simple.</b> To serve you better than anyone else can in India. And we do that by bringing you the best prices, quality services and great support. 
                   
                   <br><br>So Dear friend, if you need to travel outstation just remember our mantra...<br>
                   <b>"idhar udhar kyu khojo, just get a Gozo!"</b>
