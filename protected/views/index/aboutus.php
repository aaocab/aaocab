                <p>We are India's leader for inter-city taxi travel.</p>
                <p>  We started Gozo in November 2015, with a mission to democratize chauffeur driven taxi travel all over India with quality service, reliable delivery and a reasonable price.
                    Each member of our leadership team has global exposure & industry experience of over 20 years with complementary strengths in technology, operations and a strategic bent for disrupting markets. The founders come from education institutions like IIT Delhi, USC USA and IIM Bangalore. </p>
                <p> We've applied heuristics to decode the varied pricing structures, tariffs and tolls across the country and normalized it into an easy to understand, transparent pricing model. Our technology reduces dead-head (unbilled miles) for taxi operators. We improve cost-of-service for consumers by playing match maker in the market. Operators get business and consumers get access to vehicles on an as-needed basis. We work with licensed operators, so our supply pool is unlimited. We are focused on quality control so there is a standard for driver behavior, punctuality, vehicle condition etc. Being engineers, we measure everything so we can keep improving as each day progresses. We're deeply focused on outstation (inter-city) transport and are serving customers in over 200 cities across India.
                    We believe in continuous improvement and welcome your suggestions for improvement always.<br> Kindly feel free to email us at <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=info@gozocabs.com" target="_blank"><b>info@gozocabs.com</b></a>.</p>
