        Gozo is committed to punctuality of pickups and high quality of service for all our customers. We are able to offer one-way FLEXXI transfers at extremely low prices by pairing the requirements of multiple customers to travel together in the same taxi. Because multiple travelers are involved, you MUST BE READY ON TIME and travel per the scheduled time. Flexxi Promoters have confirmed travel plans and are looking to save money for their trip. Promoters book the car at full price and then offer unused seats in their car for Flexxi Riders to purchase. Flexxi Riders have flexible travel plans, they choose to buy unused seats in someone else taxi.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are a FLEXXI promoter, you have booked a car at the normal price and have offered to share some unused seats in your hired taxi with other Flexxi Riders. Gozo is helping find other riders to share the ride with you. If we are able to share other riders, they will share the cost of your trip and you will save money. You may cancel your trip for a full refund upto 24 hours in advance of the trip. If you cancel or reschedule within 24hours of your scheduled trip start time, your booking shall be subject to cancellation charges.

       If you are a FLEXXI rider, you have flexible plans and are looking to ride for a cheap fare in someone else taxi. You are buying a seat in a taxi that someone else has hired. Gozo is merely acting as a facilitator and enabling you and the other party to save money by sharing the ride together. If the FLEXXI promoter cancels the trip, your trip may likely also be canceled. You may cancel upto 24hours in advance of the trip. If you cancel within 24hours of your scheduled trip start time, your booking shall be subject to cancellation charges.
